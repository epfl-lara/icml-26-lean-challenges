# ShadowBench Instructions: `topology/L2/top_gen_L2_004`

## Source

- Formalize `docs/source.tex`.
- Put the final Lean snippet in `ShadowBench/Source/Main.lean`.
- Keep `ShadowBench/Source/Blueprint.md` synchronized with statement choices, source coverage, and proof notes.

## Candidate Skeletons

Dataset: `Lemmy00/ShadowBench-skeletons-prod`

- `docs/skeletons/Skeleton1.lean`
- `docs/skeletons/Skeleton2.lean`
- `docs/skeletons/Skeleton3.lean`
- `docs/skeletons/Skeleton4.lean`

Treat these as candidate statement/definition shapes, not authoritative answers. Prefer the source theorem and formalization rules when candidates disagree.

## Allowed Imports

Use these imports as the starting import block. Add imports only when Lean verification proves one is missing, and record the change in the blueprint.

```lean
import Mathlib.Order.Minimal
import Mathlib.Order.Zorn
import Mathlib.Topology.ContinuousOn
import Mathlib.Tactic.StacksAttribute
import Mathlib.Topology.DiscreteSubset
```

## Expected Declaration Names

- `exists_preirreducible`

## Formalization Rules

```text
open Set Topology

/-
Formalize in Lean the following named items from Text.

1. Theorem (exists_preirreducible)
   The theorem must be named `exists_preirreducible`.
   Matched text (candidate 1, paragraph): Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $S$ be a preirreducible subset of $X$. Then there exists
                                          a maximal preirreducible subset $T$ of $X$ containing $S$.

Every listed named item must be formalized with exactly the stated Lean name.

## Workflow Rules

- Every generated Lean file must begin with all imports before comments, namespace commands, or declarations.
- Preserve quantifier order, domains, codomains, side conditions, and named declarations from the source.
- Use candidate skeletons as search hints for initial theorem statements and definitions; verify source fidelity before keeping one.
- Do not silently weaken a theorem to make the proof easier. Record ambiguity or intentional scope changes in the blueprint.
- During drafting, `by sorry` is acceptable only as a temporary handoff to the prover loop.
- Before export, `ShadowBench/Source/Main.lean` must verify with no `sorry`, `admit`, or open goals in the submitted declarations.
